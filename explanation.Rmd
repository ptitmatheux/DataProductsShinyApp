## Explanation

This Shiny application uses the dataset NHANES (2009-2012) available through package NHANES. This is survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
The app allows to do some exploratory analysis (scatter plots of predictors + response) as well as prediction based on user's input.

Currently available predictors are Age, Weight, Height and BMI (body mass index), whereas available response variables are the following categorical variables: Gender, MaritalStatus and HHIncome.

The user can enter his/her own data. The app performs then a prediction using the rpart method based on CART algorithm.

**Note:** Obviously some combinations of predictors and predictands are unlikely to give good results. This is for illustration purpose only.
